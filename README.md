This is a program that is just like [beep](http://www.johnath.com/beep/),
except that instead of playing the sound to the PC speaker, it plays it via
ALSA to, presumably, your sound card. This may be useful if you have a computer
without a PC speaker, or if you want to test your beeping scripts using
headphones to avoid annoying other people.

abeep incorporates some code from the original beep project. That project is ©
Jonathan Nightingale and released under the terms of GPL-2; the added code in
abeep is © Christopher Head and is also released under the terms of GPL-2.
